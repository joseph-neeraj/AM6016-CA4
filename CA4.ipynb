    "# The Boston Housing Data\n",

    "Consider the data in  `keras.datasets.boston_housing`. In this case, there are only about 400 training datasets, where each dataset consists of 13 input values which are characteristic for a given property. The output corresponds to the property price. The meaning of the various columns is explained in https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the previous examples, which were categorisation problems, this is now a regression problem. The challenge is to train a network, which is able to predict the price of the property. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will again find lots of examples on the internet, and it is okay to use inspiration as long as you provide the source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adhere to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train the network on the logarithm of the price, not on the price itself. Explain why this makes sense. \n",
    "- You will find many examples, which use `sci-kit learn` or other packages, which we did not do in the course. Do not use them, and restrict yourself to methods and libraries which we covered\n",
    "- Try to find a network, which has the smallest amount of trainable parameters, while still providing good predictions of the price.  Discuss, how small you can go. \n",
    "- Once you have trained the network, explore the correlations which this network predicts:\n",
    "    - Which inputs have a positive price correlation? \n",
    "    - Which inputs have a negative price correlation? \n",
    "    - Which inputs have little/no influence on the price?\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Investigate this by feeding into the network some artificial data, which you obtain from the testing data by varying one of the input columns.\n",

    "  \n",
